Google said in March it'd cut Google Play Store fees from half-hour to fifteen for the primary million greenbacks a developer makes on the platform each year. The iPhone maker last week conjointly reversed course on another vital App Store policy: It aforesaid developers on the App Store are allowed to email users and encourage them to pay directly, rather than through Apple — a move that was previously prohibited. However, if users still create payments through the App Store, developers can need to use Apple’s charge system and pay a commission
