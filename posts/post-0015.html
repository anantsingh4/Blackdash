                <p>RED is decided to remain at the forefront of 8K recording, and its latest professional camera may simply be proof. DPReview notes that RED has unveiled  the V-Raptor ST, its 1st camera within the DSMC3 lineup. The body is barely slightly larger than the Komodo, however it touts a fresh, 35.4-megapixel VV full-frame detector that gives an oversized seventeen stops of dynamic vary and "cinema-quality" scan times doubly as quick as the other RED camera.<br>
                    You might not need to sacrifice quality for speed, either. The V-Raptor ST will shoot 16-bit REDCODE RAW video at 8K and 120 frames per second, and you'll be able to ramp it up to 600 frames per second at 2K if you are capturing slow-motion shots. whereas RED is also stretching things by claiming you'll be able to "always deliver" at larger than 4K (you clearly ought to step down in some situations), you would possibly feel a twinge of regret if your production team spent getting ready to $60,000 on a Monstro 8K that 'only' manages 60FPS at full resolution.<br>
                    The new camera includes alternative sustenance. a zealous user show on the side helps assistants tweak settings and save presets, and improved cooling (including a quiet 60mm fan) helps you're employed in harder conditions.<br>
                    You'll have access to a good range of ports, as well as two 12G-SDI outputs, nine-pin EXT (for escape boxes), USB-C and therefore the obligatory pogo pin connecter for a monitor. ODU output on the side will break out to XLR or three.5mm audio. Not astonishingly, you'll be wanting quick storage â€” RED supports compatible CFexpress 2.0 type b cards which will record R3D and ProRes at up to 800MB/s.<br>
                    The price is squarely in professional producer territory. The body alone sells for $24,500, and you will possible wish to pay $29,580 on a "Starter Pack" with helpful add-ons sort of a 7-inch touchscreen, a RED 660GB CFexpress card (plus the matching card reader) and a try of batteries. that is not as well as the RF-mount lenses and adapters you would possibly want if you are unaccustomed the RED scheme. If you are the kind who often shoots 8K video for a living, though, this may represent a discount if you are looking for high-end television equipment.
